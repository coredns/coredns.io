A new [release](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/releases/tag/v1.5.0): CoreDNS-1.5.0.

**Two** new plugins in this release: [*grpc*](/plugins/grpc), and [*ready*](/plugins/ready). And
some polish and simplifications in the core server code.

The use of **TIMEOUT** and **no_reload** in [*file*](/plugins/file) and [*auto*](/plugins/auto) have
been fully deprecated. As is the [*proxy*](/explugins/proxy/) plugin.

And a update on two important and active bugs:

* [2593](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/issues/2593) seems to hone in on Docker and/or the
  container environment being a contributing factor.

* [2624](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/issues/2624) is because of TLS session negotiating in
  the *forward* plugin.

# Plugins

* The [*ready*](/plugins/ready) plugin was added that signals a plugin is ready to receive queries. First user is the *kubernetes* plugin.
* The [*grpc*](/plugins/grpc) plugin was added to implement forwarding gRPC. If you were relying on this in the [*proxy*](/explugins/proxy) you can migrate to this one.
* The [*cancel*](/plugins/cancel) plugin was added that adds a context.WithTimeout to each context (but not
  enabled - yet).
* The [*forward*](/plugins/forward) plugin adds dnstap support.
* The [*route53*](/plugins/route53) plugin now supports wildcards.
* The [*pprof*](/plugins/pprof) plugin adds a `block` option that enables the block profiling.
* The [*prometheus*](/plugins/metrics) plugin  adds a `coredns_plugin_enabled` metric that shows which plugins are enabled.
* The [*chaos*](/plugins/chaos) plugin returns the maintainers when queried for "authors.bind TXT CH".
* The `resyncperiod` option in [*kubernetes*](/plugins/kubernetes) now defaults to zero seconds, which disables resyncing.

# Deprecations

* The `resyncperiod` option in [*kubernetes*](/plugins/kubernetes) is deprecated
  and will be made a no-op in 1.6.0 and removed in 1.7.0.
