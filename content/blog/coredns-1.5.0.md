A new [release](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/releases/tag/v1.5.0): CoreDNS-1.5.0.

**Two** new plugins in this release: [*grpc*](/plugins/grpc), and [*ready*](/plugins/ready). And
some polish and simplifications in the core server code.

The use of **TIMEOUT** and **no_reload** in [*file*](/plugins/file) and [*auto*](/plugins/auto) have
been fully deprecated. As is the [*proxy*](/explugins/proxy/) plugin.

And a update on two important and active bugs:

* [2593](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/issues/2593) seems to hone in on Docker and/or the
  container environment being a contributing factor.

* [2624](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/issues/2624) is because of TLS session negotiating in
  the *forward* plugin.

# Plugins

* a new [*ready*](/plugins/ready) was added that signals a plugin is ready to receive queries. First user is the *kubernetes* plugin.
* a new [*grpc*](/plugins/grpc) was added to implement forwarding gRPC. If you were relying on this in the [*proxy*](/explugins/proxy) you can migrate to this one.
* the [*cancel*](/plugins/cancel) was added that adds a context.WithTimeout to each context (but not
  enabled - yet).
* the [*forward*](/plugins/forward) adds dnstap support.
* the [*route53*](/plugins/route53) now supports wildcards.
* the [*pprof*](/plugins/pprof) adds a `block` option that enables the block profiling.
* the [*prometheus*](/plugins/metrics)  adds a `coredns_plugin_enabled` metric that shows which plugins are enabled.
