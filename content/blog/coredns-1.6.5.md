The CoreDNS team has released
[CoreDNS-1.6.5](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/releases/tag/v1.6.5).

A fairly small release that polishes various plugins and fixes a bunch of bugs.

# Plugins

A new plugin [*transfer*](/plugins/transfer) that encapsulates the zone transfer knowledge and code
in one place. This makes it easier to add this functionality to new plugins. Plugins that already
implement zone transfers are expected to move to it in the 1.7.0 release.

* [*forward*](/plugins/forward) don't block on returning sockets; instead timeout and drop the
  socket on the floor, this makes each go-routine guarantee to exit.
* [*kubernetes*](/plugins/kubernetes) adds metrics to measure kubernetes control plane latency, see
  documentation for details.
* [*file*](/plugins/file) fixes a panic when comparing domains names.
