The CoreDNS team has released
[CoreDNS-1.8.0](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/releases/tag/v1.8.0).

If you are running 1.7.1 you want to upgrade for the *cache* plugin fixes.

This release also adds three backwards incompatible changes. This will only affect you if you have an
**external plugin** or use **outgoing zone transfers**. If you're using `dnstap` in your plugin,
you'll need to upgrade to the new API as detailed in it's [documentation](/plugins/dnstap).

Two, because Caddy is now developing a version 2 and we are using version 1, we've internalized
Caddy into <https://github.com/coredns/caddy>. This means the `caddy` types change and *all* plugins
need to fix the import path from: `github.com/caddyserver/caddy` to `github.com/coredns/caddy` (this
can thankfully be automated).

And lastly, the `transfer` plugin is now made a first class citizen and plugins wanting to perform
outgoing zone transfers now use this plugin: *file*, *auto*, *secondary* and *kubernetes* are
converted. For this you must change your Corefile from (e.g.):

``` txt
example.org {
    file example.org.signed {
        transfer to *
        transfer to 10.240.1.1
    }
}
```

To

``` txt
example.org {
    file example.org.signed
    transfer {
        to * 10.240.1.1
    }
}
```
