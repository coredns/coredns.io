We are pleased to announce the [release](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/releases/tag/v1.4.0)
of CoreDNS-1.4.0! Our first release after we became a graduated project in
[CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/).

Deprecation notice for the *next* release:

 *  [*auto*](/plugins/auto) will deprecate **TIMEOUT** and recommends the use of RELOAD ([2516](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/issues/2516)).
 *  [*auto*](/plugins/file) and [*file*](/plugins/auto) will deprecate NO_RELOAD and recommends the use of RELOAD set to 0 ([2536](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/issues/2536)).
 *  [*health*](/plugins/health) will revert back to report process level health without plugin
    status. A new *ready* plugin will make sure plugins have at least completed their startup
    sequence.
 *  The [*proxy*](/plugins/proxy) will be moved to an external repository and as such be deprecated
    from the default set of plugin; use the [*forward*](/plugins/forward) as a replacement.

The [previous](/2019/01/13/coredns-1.3.1-release/) announced deprecations have been enacted.

The (unused) gRPC watch functionally was removed from the server.

Note we're actively working on two (probably related) bugs
([2593](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/issues/2593),
[2624](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/issues/2624)) which should hopefully result in a fix and
a new release fairly quickly.

# Plugins

Random updates in documentation and fixes in tests and various plugins.

 *  [*kubernetes*](/plugins/kubernetes) fixes the logging now that kubernetes' client lib switched
    to klog from glog.

 *  [*hosts*](/plugins/hosts) fixes IPv4 addresses in IPV6 syntax.

 *  [*etcd*](/plugins/etcd) adds credential support and a fix for the reply when the `host` field is
    empty.

 *  [*log*](/plugins/log) has been made more efficient.

 *  [*forward*](/plugins/forward) drops out of order messages, this is solve occasionally FORMERRs
    people saw.
