Since almost a year Google has a DNS service that can be queried over HTTPS:
<https://dns.google.com>. This means your queries are encrypted and can only be seen by you (and
Google(!)). Seeing all the press about the
[UK's snooper's charter](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2016/nov/24/how-can-i-protect-myself-from-government-snoopers)
I though I should implement this as a plugin in CoreDNS.

I'm (obviously) going to use this myself; which is perfect as it protects me and it allows me to
dog food CoreDNS as a DNS proxy in my home network.

A note worthy other implementation is "dingo": <https://github.com/pforemski/dingo>.

Also note that this a *different* protocol than "DNS over TLS" which has similar goals and is being
standardized by the IETF.

The configuration on the CoreDNS side is pretty straight forward. The following Corefile is all
you'll need:

~~~ corefile
. {
    proxy . dns.google.com {
        protocol https_google
    }
    cache
    log
    errors
}
~~~

Next start CoreDNS, and query it.

~~~ sh
% ./coredns
.:53
2016/11/26 17:11:07 [INFO] CoreDNS-003
CoreDNS-003
::1 - [26/Nov/2016:17:13:10 +0000] "MX IN miek.nl. udp false 4096" NOERROR 246 149.791162ms
::1 - [26/Nov/2016:17:13:11 +0000] "MX IN miek.nl. udp false 4096" NOERROR 170 156.432Âµs
~~~

The only unencrypted DNS used is from your laptop/phone/computer to CoreDNS, the rest is encrypted.

By default, `dns.google.com` will be re-resolved every 30 seconds using 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 (you can
override these defaults). This is the only query not encrypted, but this will probably lead to
a very boring browser history.

Next, *I* need to configure a Raspberry Pi and install CoreDNS on it. And as with all CoreDNS
developements [feedback is welcome](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/issues).
