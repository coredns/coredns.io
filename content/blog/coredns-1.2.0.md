We are pleased to announce the [release](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/releases/tag/v1.2.0) of
CoreDNS-1.2.0!

In this release we have a new plugin, bump etcd to version 3 and bugfixes.

# Core

Enable watch functionality when CoreDNS is used as a gRPC server (documented in the code - for now).

# Plugins

* A new plugin called [*metadata*](/plugins/metadata) was added. It adds metadata to a query, via the context.
* The *etcd* plugin now supports etcd version 3 (only!). It was impossible to support v2 *and* v3 at
  the same time (even as separate plugins); so we decided to drop v2 support.
* Fix a race/crash in the *cache* plugin when `prefetch` is enabled.
* The *forward* has a `prefer_udp` option, that even when the incoming query is over TCP, the
  outgoing one will be tried over UDP first.
* *secondary* plugin has a bug fix for zone expiration: don't expire zones if we can reach the
  primary, but see no zone changes.
* The *auto* plugin now works better with Kubernetes Configmaps.
