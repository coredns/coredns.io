The CoreDNS team has released
[CoreDNS-1.6.9](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/releases/tag/v1.6.9). This release is identical
to 1.6.8.

(Yes there was a [CoreDNS-1.6.8](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/releases/tag/v1.6.8), but our
automation broke after tagging it in Git - hence another bump in the minor version)

Again a small release with some nice improvements in the *forward* plugin, and overall polish. See
"Noteworthy Changes" for more detail.

Note that 1.7.0 will contain a bunch of backward incompatible changes: the *federation* plugin will
be full removed and the metrics name will be changed to inline with the naming recommendation from
the Prometheus project.
