We are pleased to announce the [release](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/releases/tag/v1.0.0) of CoreDNS-1.0.0!

Release 1.0.0 and other recent releases have focused on improving the performance and
functionality of the *kubernetes* plugin, since CoreDNS is now on track to eventually
[replace kube-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/427) as the default
cluster DNS in Kubernetes.

As part of the [Kubernetes proposal](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/1100), we have shown that CoreDNS
not only provides more functionality than kube-dns, but performs much better while using less memory. In our tests,
[CoreDNS](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/1100#issuecomment-337747482) running against a cluster with 5000
services was able to process 18,000 queries per second using 73MB of RAM, while
[kube-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/1100#issuecomment-338329100) achieved 7,000qps using 97MB of RAM.
This can be partial ascribed to CoreDNS simpler runtime - a single process instead of a combination of several processes.

CoreDNS also implements a number of Kubernetes-related features that are not part of kube-dns, including:

* Filtering of records by namespace
* Filtering of records by label selector
* `pods verified` mode, which ensures that a Pod exists before returning an answer for a `pod.cluster.local` query
* `endpoint_pod_names` which uses [Pod names](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/47992) for service endpoint records if the hostname is not set
* `autopath` which provides a server-side implementation of the namespace-specific search path. This can cut down the query latency from pods dramatically.

As a general-purpose DNS server, CoreDNS also enables many other use cases that would be difficult or impossible to
achieve with kube-dns, such as the ability to create [custom DNS entries](https://coredns.io/2017/05/08/custom-dns-entries-for-kubernetes/).

We are excited to continue our contributions to the Kubernetes community, and CoreDNS is being incorporated as a 1.9 alpha feature into a variety
of Kubernetes deployment mechanisms, including upcoming versions of [kubeadm](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubeadm), [kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops), [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube), and [kubespray](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/kubespray).

Of course, there is more to 1.0.0 than just the Kubernetes work. See below for the details on all the changes.

## Core

* Fixed a bug in the gRPC server that prevented *dnstap* from working with it.
* Additional fuzz testing to ferret out obscure bugs.
* Documentation and configuration cleanups.

## Plugins
* *log* no longer accepts `stdout` in the configuration (use of a file was removed in a previous release). All logging is always to STDOUT. This is a backwards **incompatible** change, so be sure to check your Corefile for this.
* *health* now checks plugins that support it for health and reflects that in the server health.
* *kubernetes* now shows healthy only after the initial API sync is complete.
* *kubernetes* has bug fixes and performance improvements.
* *kubernetes* now has an option to use pod names instead of IPs in service endpoint records when the `hostname` is not set.
* *metrics* have been revised to provide better histograms. You will need to change your Prometheus queries as metric names have changed to comply with Prometheus best practices.
* *erratic* now supports the health check.
