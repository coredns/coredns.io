We are pleased to announce the [release](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/releases/tag/v1.3.0) of
CoreDNS-1.3.0!

## Core

In this release we do the EDNS0 handling in the server and make it compliant with
[https://dnsflagday.net/](https://dnsflagday.net/). This fits a theme where we move more and more
protocol details into the server to make life easier for plugin authors.

# Plugins

*  [*k8s_external*](/plugin/ks8_external) a new plugin that allows external zones to point to
   Kubernetes in-cluster services.

*  [*rewrite*](/plugins/rewrite) fixes a bug where a rule would eat the first character of a name

*  [*log*](/plugins/log) now supported the [*metadata*](/plugins/metadata) labels. It also fixes a
   bug in the formatting of a plugin logging a info/failure/warning

*  [*forward*](/plugin/forward) removes the dynamic read timeout and uses a fixed value now.

*  [*kubernetes*](/plugin/kubernetes) now checks if a zone transfer is allowed. Also allow a TTL of
   0 to avoid caching in the cache plugin.
