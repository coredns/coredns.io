We are pleased to announce the [release](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/releases/tag/v1.1.3) of
CoreDNS-1.1.3!

This release has fixes in the plugins, small core updates and experimental DNS over HTTPs support.
We also announce the deprecation of a few things.

# Core

*Experimental* DNS-over-HTTPS support was added in the server. Use `https://` as the server's scheme
 in the configuration.

The `-log` flag actually doesn't do anything, so this is a deprecation notice that this flag will be
removed in the next release.

# Plugins

* [*metrics*](/plugin/metrics) All in-tree plugins serve metrics with a `server` label.
   * *cache* and *dnssec* drop the capacity metrics
   * add a panic counter: `coredns_panic_count_total`
* [*etcd*](/plugins/etcd) supports A and AAAA record under the zone's apex.
* [*rewrite*](/plugins/rewrite) now handles `continue` in response rewrites.
* [*forward*](/plugin/forward) clean ups, esp when shutting it down.
* [*cache*](/plugin/cache) adds some optimization.
* [*kubernetes*](/plugin/kubernetes) adds option to `ignore` services without ready endpoints.
* Deprecation notice for the *reverse* plugin.
* Deprecation notice for the `https_google` protocol in *proxy*.
