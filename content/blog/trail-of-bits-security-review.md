Trail of Bits (https://trailofbits.com) conducted a security review and threat model of CoreDNS.

Quoting from the security review summary:

> "The audit uncovered one high-severity issue (TOB-CDNS-8) concerning a bug that could lead to cache poisoning attacks.
> The majority of the other issues are of informational or low severity; these include several resulting from insufficient
> data validation, specifically from assumptions about the data processed by various functions, which we discovered by
> running fuzzing harnesses. Most of the findings pertain to denial-of-service vulnerabilities."
