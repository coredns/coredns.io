This release improves plugin reliability and standards compliance, adding startup timeout to the Kubernetes
plugin, fallthrough to gRPC, and EDNS0 unset to rewrite. The file plugin now preserves SRV record case per
RFC 6763, route53 is updated to AWS SDK v2, and multiple race conditions in cache and connection handling in
forward are fixed.
