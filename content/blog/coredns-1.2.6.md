We are pleased to announce the [release](https://github.com/coredns/coredns/releases/tag/v1.2.6) of
CoreDNS-1.2.6!

## Core

Ignore the error when setting SO_REUSEPORT on a socket fails; this makes CoreDNS work on older
kernels.

## Plugins

*  [*etcd*](/plugins/etcd) has seen minor bugfixes.

*  [*loop*](/plugins/loop) fixes a bug when dealing with a failing upstream.

*  [*log*](/plugins/log) unifies all logging (done by this plugin and normal logs) and always use
   RFC3339 timestamps (with millisecond accuracy). The `{when}` verb has been made a noop, it will
   be removed in the next release.

*  [*cache*](/plugins/cache) got some minor optimizations.

*  [*errors*](/plugins/errors) (and *log*) gotten a new option (`consolidate`) to suppress logging.

*  [*hosts*](/plugins/hosts) will now read the `hosts` file without holding a write lock.

*  [*route53*](/plugins/route53) makes the upstream optional.
