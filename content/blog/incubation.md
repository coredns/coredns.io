CoreDNS has just graduated to the
[incubation](https://twitter.com/CloudNativeFdn/status/968223259643858951) level in the
[CNCF](https://cncf.io). This means we're now on the same footing as, say, the Kubernetes project.

Thanks to all the contributers and users for making CoreDNS what it is today!
