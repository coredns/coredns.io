Normally, the listener binds to the wildcard host. However, you may force the listener to bind to
another IP instead. This directive accepts only an address, not a port.

## Syntax

~~~ txt
bind ADDRESS
~~~

**ADDRESS** is the IP address to bind to.

## Examples

To make your socket accessible only to that machine, bind to IP 127.0.0.1 (localhost):

~~~
. {
    bind 127.0.0.1
}
~~~
