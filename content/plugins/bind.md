## Description

Normally, the listener binds to the wildcard host. However, you may want the listener to bind to
another IP instead.      

If several addresses are provided, a listener will be open on each of the IP provided.

Each address has to be an IP of one of the interfaces of the host.

## Syntax

~~~ txt
bind ADDRESS  ...
~~~

**ADDRESS** is an IP address to bind to.
When several addresses are provided a listener will be opened on each of the addresses.

## Examples

To make your socket accessible only to that machine, bind to IP 127.0.0.1 (localhost):

~~~ corefile
. {
    bind 127.0.0.1
}
~~~

To allow processing DNS requests only local host on both IPv4 and IPv6 stacks, use the syntax:

~~~ corefile
. {
    bind 127.0.0.1 ::1
}
~~~

If the configuration comes up with several *bind* directives, all addresses are consolidated together:
The following sample is equivalent to the preceding:
 
~~~ corefile
. {
    bind 127.0.0.1 
    bind ::1
}
~~~
