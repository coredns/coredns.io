## Description

CoreDNS supports queries that are encrypted using TLS (DNS over Transport Layer Security, RFC 7858)
or are using gRPC (https://grpc.io/, not an IETF standard). Normally DNS traffic isn't encrypted at
all (DNSSEC only signs resource records).

The *proxy* plugin also support gRPC (`protocol gRPC`), meaning you can chain CoreDNS servers
using this protocol.

The *tls* "plugin" allows you to configure the cryptographic keys that are needed for both
DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-gRPC. If the `tls` directive is omitted, then no encryption takes place.

The gRPC protobuffer is defined in `pb/dns.proto`. It defines the proto as a simple wrapper for the
wire data of a DNS message.

## Syntax

~~~ txt
tls CERT KEY [CA]
~~~

Parameter CA is optional. If not set, system CAs can be used to verify the client certificate

## Examples

Start a DNS-over-TLS server that picks up incoming DNS-over-TLS queries on port 5553 and uses the
nameservers defined in `/etc/resolv.conf` to resolve the query. This proxy path uses plain old DNS.

~~~
tls://.:5553 {
	tls cert.pem key.pem ca.pem
	proxy . /etc/resolv.conf
}
~~~

Start a DNS-over-gRPC server that is similar to the previous example, but using DNS-over-gRPC for
incoming queries.

~~~
grpc://. {
	tls cert.pem key.pem ca.pem
	proxy . /etc/resolv.conf
}
~~~

Only Knot DNS' `kdig` supports DNS-over-TLS queries, no command line client supports gRPC making
debugging these transports harder than it should be.
