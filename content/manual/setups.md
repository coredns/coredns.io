# Setups

Here you can find a bunch of configurations for CoreDNS. All setups are done assuming you are not the
root user and hence can't start listening on port 53. We will use port 1053 instead, using the
`-dns.port` flag. In every setup the configuration file used is the CoreDNS' default, named: `Corefile`.
This means we *don't need* to specify the configuration file with the `-conf` flag. In other words,
we start CoreDNS with `./coredns -dns.port=1053 -conf Corefile`, which can be abbreviated to
`./coredns -dns.port=1053`.

All DNS queries will be generated with the [`dig`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dig_(command))
tool: the gold standard for debugging DNS. The *full* command line we use here is:
~~~ sh
$ dig -p 1053 @localhost +noall +answer <name> <type>
~~~
But we shorten it in the setups below, so `dig www.example.org A` is really:
`dig -p 1053 @localhost +noall +answer www.example.org A`

## Authoritative Serving from Files

This setup uses the [*file*](/plugins/file) plugin. Note the external [*redis*](/plugins/redis)
enables authoritative serving from a Redis Database. Let's continue with the setup using *file*.

The file we create here is a DNS zone file, and can have any name (*file* plugin doesn't care). The
data we are putting in the file is for the zone `example.org.`:

In your current directory, create a file named `db.example.org` and put the following contents in
it:

~~~ dns
$ORIGIN example.org.
@	3600 IN	SOA sns.dns.icann.org. noc.dns.icann.org. (
				2017042745 ; serial
				7200       ; refresh (2 hours)
				3600       ; retry (1 hour)
				1209600    ; expire (2 weeks)
				3600       ; minimum (1 hour)
				)

	3600 IN NS a.iana-servers.net.
	3600 IN NS b.iana-servers.net.

www     IN A     127.0.0.1
        IN AAAA  ::1
~~~
The last two lines are defining a nam `www.example.org.` with two addresses, 127.0.0.1 and (the
IPv6) ::1.

Next, create this minimal `Corefile` the handles queries for this domain and adds the
[*log*](/plugins/log) plugin to enable query logging:

~~~ corefile
example.org {
    file db.example.org
    log
}
~~~

Start CoreDNS and query it with `dig`:

~~~ sh
$ dig www.example.org AAAA

www.example.org.    3600    IN  AAAA    ::1
~~~

It works. Because of the *log* plugin we should also see the query being logged:

~~~ txt
::1 - [22/Feb/2018:10:21:01 +0000] "AAAA IN www.example.org. udp 45 false 4096" NOERROR qr,aa,rd,ra 121 170.195Âµs
~~~

The above logs show us the address CoreDNS replied from (`::1`) and the time and date it did.
Further it logs the query type, query class and the query name. Next the protocol used (`udp`), the
size in bytes of the incoming request, the DO bit state, and the advertised UDP buffer size. This is
data from the incoming query. `NOERROR` signals the start of the reply, which is the Response Code
sent back. Then the set of flags on the reply: `qr,aa,rd,ra`. The size of the reply in byes
(121) and the duration it took to get the reply.

## Forwarder

CoreDNS can be configured to forward traffic to an recursor. We currently have two plugin that allow
for this, [*proxy*](/plugins/proxy) and [*forward*](/plugins/forward). Here we will use *forward*
and focus on the most basic setup: forwarding to Google Public DNS (8.8.8.8) and Quad9 DNS
(9.9.9.9).

We don't need to create anything, except file out a Corefile, with the configuration we want. In
this case we want *all* queries hitting CoreDNS to be forward to either 8.8.8.8 or 9.9.9.9:

~~~ corefile
. {
    forward . 8.8.8.8 9.9.9.9
}
~~~
Note that *forward* and *proxy* allow you to fine tune the names it will send upstream, here we
choose all names (`.`). For instance: `forward example.com 8.8.8.8 9.9.9.9` would only forward names
within the `example.com.` domain.

Start CoreDNS and test it with `dig`:
~~~ sh
$ dig www.example.org AAAA
www.example.org.	25837	IN	AAAA	2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:194
~~~

And in the logs:
~~~
:1 - [22/Feb/2018:10:34:39 +0000] 36325 "AAAA IN www.example.org. udp 45 false 4096" NOERROR qr,rd,ra,ad 73 1.859369ms
~~~

line conveys.
