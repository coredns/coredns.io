# External Plugins

CoreDNS comes with a large set of plugins, but not all (existing) plugins are included in the
default install. You can find [external plugins on our website](/explugins), or develop one
yourself.

Enabling plugins is a compile time affair in CoreDNS, so you'll need to have [CoreDNS' source
code](/installation.md#source).
