# External Plugins

CoreDNS comes with a decent set of plugins, but not all plugins are included in the default install.
You can easily find [external plugins on our website](/explugins), or develop one yourself.

Enabling plugins is a compile time affair in CoreDNS, so you'll need to have [CoreDNS' source
code](/installation.md#source).
