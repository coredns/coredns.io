We welcome community contributions! Please see the

## Project Governance
CoreDNS is an independent open-source project and not controlled by any single company.
To emphasize this and clarify our governance structure, we joined the [Cloud Native Computing
Foundation](https://cncf.io) in 2017.

## Code of Conduct
To make CoreDNS a welcoming and harassment-free experience for everyone, we follow the [CNCF Code
of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)
